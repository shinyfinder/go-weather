	<button class="accordion">What is GWS?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>GWS is a webtool used to serve the current weather conditions at different latitude/longitude coordinates from around the world. Weather conditions are classified according to those used in Pok&eacute;mon GO.</p>
	</div>
	<br />
	<button class="accordion">What weather information is used?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>Weather information is provded by <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/">AccuWeather</a> and <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> via their respective APIs. Sattelite imagery is provided by <a href="https://owm.io/sat">OWM.io/vane:</a>.</p>
	</div>
	<br />
	<button class="accordion">How often is the weather updated?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>The weather information is updated hourly, at 16 minutes past the hour. Wind data is updated upon loading of the map.</p>
	</div>
<br />
	<button class="accordion">How does this tool work?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>GWS queries the weather APIs every hour and saves the data on the server. This allows anyone to access the weather data via the tool without having to perform a new API call. The weather is then sorted into the categories used by Pok&eacute;mon GO and returned upon request.</p>
	</div>
<br />
	<button class="accordion">What language was the tool written in?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>The tool (front end and back end) is entrirely written in javascript.</p>
	</div>
<br />
	<button class="accordion">Do you have weather information for [city]?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>The cities GWS searches are the top 150 cities as reported by <a href="https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-current-conditions-api/apis/get/currentconditions/v1/topcities/%7Bgroup%7D">AccuWeather</a>. Due to API limitations, this number cannot currently be increased. If you are looking for the weather in a certain city, it's probably better to go to AccuWeather.com or similar and look it up for that particular location.</p>
	</div>
<br />
	<button class="accordion">Can you report forcast data?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>Available forcast data is currently limited to daily forcasts for the next 5 days due to API limitations. Because the in-game weather is updated hourly, it does not make sense to provide this information at this time.</p>
	</div>
<br />
	<button class="accordion">GWS says the weather is [x], but GO says the weather is [y]. What's up?</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>The specifics of how Niantic determines the in-game weather are currently unknown. It is speculated that level 10 S2 cells are used in determining the in-game weather, as provided by the real weather supplied by AccuWeather. How the weather is averaged into these cells, when the information is updated, and what defintions Niantic uses for the in-game conditions are not available to us. This tool attempts to fill in the gaps based on community-based research; however, the results may be inaccurate. Until we have GO's source code, we'll never know for sure how the weather is determined, and that may never happen.</p>
